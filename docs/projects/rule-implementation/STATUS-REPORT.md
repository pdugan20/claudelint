# Rule Implementation Status Report

**Date**: 2026-01-28 (Updated)
**Status**: All documentation validation passing
**Critical Issue**: Configuration integration missing (BLOCKER)

## Executive Summary

This report provides an accurate assessment of the rule implementation project status by comparing project documentation claims against actual codebase implementation.

### Current Status

 **Documentation Validation**: All passing (0 violations)
 **Missing Docs**: 14 implemented rules need documentation (down from 15)
 **Implementation**: 22 fully implemented rules (10% of 219 total)
 **Ghost Rules**: 19 of 20 fixed (98% complete)
 **Not Started**: 177 rules (81%)
 **BLOCKER**: Config integration not implemented

## Critical Blocker: Configuration Integration

**PRIORITY: HIGHEST - Must fix before continuing with rules**

### The Problem

claudelint has complete configuration infrastructure:
-  `.claudelintrc.json` file loading
-  Config validation commands (`validate-config`, `print-config`)
-  Documentation showing config usage
-  Example configs in repo

But validators **don't use any of it**:
-  Rules set to `"off"` still run
-  Severity overrides are ignored
-  Rule options are never accessed
-  File-specific overrides don't apply

### Impact

Users expect this to work:
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "size-error": "off",
    "size-warning": { "severity": "warn", "options": { "maxSize": 60000 } }
  }
}
```

But rules hardcode severity and always run. **This is a critical gap.**

### The Fix

Implement config integration (3-4 days):
1. `ConfigResolver` - Resolves effective config per file
2. Enhanced `BaseValidator` - Add `isRuleEnabled()`, `getRuleOptions()`
3. Rule options support with Zod schemas
4. Integration testing

**Tracker**: IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST task #4

## Validation Status

**Documentation**:  PASSING
- 0 violations
- 2 warnings (expected - rules needing docs)

**Recent Work**:
- Fixed 19 of 20 ghost rules
- Documented 14 implemented rules
- Created config integration proposal

## True Implementation Status

Based on exploring src/validators/ and src/rules/rule-ids.ts:

**Rule IDs Defined**: 42 total
**Rule IDs Actually Used**: 22 (52% of defined rules)

| Validator | Defined | Used with ID | Ghost Rules | Percentage |
|-----------|---------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| CLAUDE.md | 8 | 7 | 1 | 87% |
| Skills | 14 | 8 | 6 | 57% |
| Settings | 4 | 1 | 3 | 25% |
| Hooks | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0% |
| MCP | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0% |
| Plugin | 5 | 3 | 2 | 60% |
| Commands | 3 | 3 | 0 | 100% |
| Agents | 2 | 1 | 1 | 50% |
| **Total** | **42** | **22** | **20** | **52%** |

## The "Ghost Rules" Problem

Twenty rules have validation logic implemented but fail to pass the rule ID parameter to `reportError()`/`reportWarning()` calls. This means:

- Users cannot configure these rules (enable/disable, change severity)
- Rules don't appear in lint output with proper IDs
- Documentation exists but implementation is incomplete

**Ghost Rules by Validator:**

**Skills (6 ghost rules):**
- `skill-dangerous-command` - Logic at line 565-572, no rule ID
- `skill-eval-usage` - Logic at line 576-592, no rule ID
- `skill-path-traversal` - Logic at line 595-601, no rule ID
- `skill-too-many-files` - Logic at line 234, no rule ID
- `skill-deep-nesting` - Logic at line 244, no rule ID
- `skill-missing-examples` - Logic at line 331, no rule ID

**Settings (3 ghost rules):**
- `settings-invalid-schema` - Schema validation present, no rule ID
- `settings-invalid-permission` - Logic at line 71-124, no rule ID
- `settings-invalid-env-var` - Logic at line 155-164, no rule ID

**Hooks (3 ghost rules):**
- `hooks-invalid-event` - Defined but not used
- `hooks-missing-script` - Defined but not used
- `hooks-invalid-config` - Schema validation present, no rule ID

**MCP (3 ghost rules):**
- `mcp-invalid-server` - Defined but not used
- `mcp-invalid-transport` - Defined but not used
- `mcp-invalid-env-var` - Logic at lines 81-224, no rule ID

**Plugin (2 ghost rules):**
- `plugin-invalid-manifest` - Schema validation at line 325, no rule ID
- `plugin-invalid-version` - Semver check at line 92, no rule ID

**Agents (1 ghost rule):**
- `agent-skills-not-found` - Defined but not used

**CLAUDE.md (1 ghost rule):**
- `frontmatter-invalid-paths` - Defined but not used

**Other (1 ghost rule):**
- `commands-in-plugin-deprecated` - In PluginValidator line 66

## Rules Needing Documentation

15 implemented rules are missing documentation:

- `import-in-code-block`
- `frontmatter-invalid-paths`
- `rules-circular-symlink`
- `filename-case-sensitive`
- `skill-time-sensitive-content`
- `skill-body-too-long`
- `skill-large-reference-no-toc`
- `agent-hooks-invalid-schema`
- `agent-skills-not-found`
- `settings-permission-invalid-rule`
- `plugin-circular-dependency`
- `plugin-dependency-invalid-version`
- `commands-deprecated-directory`
- `commands-migrate-to-skills`
- `commands-in-plugin-deprecated`

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Fix 20 Ghost Rules** (2-4 hours) ← HIGHEST PRIORITY
   - Add rule ID parameters to reportError/reportWarning calls
   - Test that rules appear in output correctly
   - Critical for rule configurability

2. **Document 15 Implemented Rules** (1-2 hours)
   - Create docs for rules listed above
   - Use TEMPLATE.md
   - Validate as you go

3. **Review Git Changes** (30-60 min)
   - 6 validators have uncommitted changes
   - Decide: commit, revert, or finish incomplete work

## Long-Term Work

**Implement Remaining 177 Rules** (4-6 weeks):
- 85 Schema rules (easiest)
- 63 Refinement rules (moderate)
- 29 Logic rules (complex)

## Progress Metrics

- **Fully Implemented**: 22/219 rules (10%)
- **Partial Implementation**: 20/219 rules (9%)
- **Not Started**: 177/219 rules (81%)
- **Documentation Coverage**: 27/42 defined rules (64%)

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix Ghost Rules First (Priority 1)

**Why**: These rules have logic but aren't usable. Quick fix, big impact.

**How**: Add rule ID parameter to each reportError/reportWarning call.

**Example**:
```typescript
// Before (ghost rule)
this.reportError('Dangerous command detected');

// After (proper rule)
this.reportError('Dangerous command detected', {
  ruleId: 'skill-dangerous-command',
  line: lineNumber
});
```

### 2. Document Implemented Rules (Priority 2)

**Why**: Users need docs to understand rules.

**How**: Use docs/rules/TEMPLATE.md, create one doc per rule.

### 3. Implement Remaining Rules (Priority 3)

**Why**: Complete the project.

**How**: Batch by validator, prioritize by type (Schema → Refinement → Logic).

## Conclusion

The project has made progress but documentation was inflating the numbers. The actual status is:
- **10%** complete (not 44% as previously claimed)
- **20 ghost rules** need quick fixes to be usable
- **15 rules** need documentation
- **177 rules** remain to be implemented

The path forward is clear:
1. Fix ghost rules (2-4 hours)
2. Document implemented rules (1-2 hours)
3. Implement remaining rules systematically (4-6 weeks)
